Description: The package is able to perform an automatic or interactive quality
    control on FCS data acquired using flow cytometry instruments. By evaluating
    three different properties: 1) flow rate, 2) signal acquisition, 3) dynamic
    range, the quality control enables the detection and removal of anomalies.
